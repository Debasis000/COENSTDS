        <h4>About us</h4>
        <p>The Centre started in the winter of 2018 with a funding from OHEPEE Department of Higher Education, Govt. of
            Odisha, India, under World Bank, appointing Dr. N. K. Sahoo (distinguished scientist and former Associate
            Director of physics group, Bhaba atomic research centre (BARC), Visakhapatnam, India) as the Mentor. It is
            being co-ordinated by Prof. Sukanta Kumar Tripathy, Dept. of Physics, with active support from four other
            faculty members of Berhampur University, along with three postdoctoral fellows and ten research students
            working actively with a variety of research ideas. The centre currently conducting several projects funded
            by DST, DAE (Govt. of India) and OURIIP(Govt. of Odisha, India).<br>
            Main Goals of the centre include development of low cost optical sensors for healthcare, food security and
            environment applications, based on Nano science and technology and prototyping them. Additionally, it is
            also focusing oncreating experimental facilities that will be used to train the faculty and research
            students in Universities and Colleges of the state. It is also aspiring to establish a networking and
            scientific collaboration with reputed organizations in India and abroad. <br>Apart from these, to create new
            intellectual property right (IPR), andto secure other funded research schemes in collaboration with other
            universities are also some of the main objectives of the centre.
            Our area of expertize include design and characterization of hybrid nano materials for sensing, drug
            delivery, industry effluent treatment, design and simulation of invasive and non-invasive photonic
            biosensors,SPR based photonic biosensors, design and simulation of thin film devices for energy harvesting
            applications, etc.
